			<h1> CSS Layout - The position Property</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>The <span> position</span> property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).</p>
			<article>
				<h2> The position Property</h2>
				<p>The <span> position</span> property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.</p>
				<p>There are five different position values:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>static</li>
					<li>relative</li>
					<li>fixed</li>
					<li>absolute</li>
					<li>sticky</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the <span>position</span> property is set first.
				   They also work differently depending on the position value.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>My first position is <span><i><b>static</b></i></span>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><q>Static positioned elements are <b>not affected by the top, bottom, left,</b> and <b>right</b> properties.
					  An element with <span><b>position: static</b></span>; is not positioned in any special way; it is always <b>positioned according to the normal flow</b> of the page.</q></p>
				<div class="static">
					Where will this position? Let me find out...
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>The second of position is <span><i><b>relative</b></i></span>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><q>Setting the <b>top, right, bottom,</b> and <b>left</b> properties of a <span>relatively-positioned</span> element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position.
					  Other content <b>will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element</b>.</q></p>
				<div class="relative">
					Where will this position? Let me find out...
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>The third of position is <span><i><b>fixed</b></i></span>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><q>An element with <span>position: fixed</span>; is positioned relative to the <b>viewport</b>, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
					  The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element. A fixed element <b>does not leave a gap in the page</b> where it would normally have been located.</q></p>
				<div class="fixed">
					Do you know this position? Try to catch me <i class="material-icons">computer</i>
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>My next position is <span><i><b>absolute</b></i></span>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><q>An element with <span>position: absolute</span>; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned <b>ancestor</b> (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
					  However; if an absolute positioned <b>element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling</b>.
					  A "positioned" element is one whose position is anything except static.</q></p>
				<div class="absolute">
					Have you done? Can you see? It is easy, just do it!
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>The last position is <span><i><b>sticky</b></i></span>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><q>An element with <span>position: sticky</span>; is positioned based on the user's <b>scroll position</b>.
					  A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport -
					  then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).</q></p>
				<div class="sticky">
					It was hard but I realize how it works!
				</div>
				<p><b><span>To check it I have to add more contents!</span></b></p>
				<div>
					<h3>What is Loren Ipsum?</h3>
					<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer
					   took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
					   unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
					   Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
					<h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
					<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
					   more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web
					   page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
					   over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
					<h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
					<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
					   McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through
					   the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
					   (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
					   "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
					<p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are
					   also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
					<h3>Where can I get some?</h3>
					<p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look
					   even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
					   generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words,
					   combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected
					   humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
